Backstory

The players first will be set on top of a burning hotel. They travel down, fighting and discovering mutations of zombies and normal zombies as well. In the past, they were supposed to get rescued by a helicopter, but the helicopter left them since the pilot couldn’t see them. They don’t know each other but there’s a part in the game where they introduce themselves. For my prompt: It’s a virus that mutates daily and uncontrollably, the survivors have to adapt to the infected and the mutated infected as well. 

Characters

It will be 4 people with different backgrounds: Wendell, a football coach. Mark, a con artist with a fancy suit, Beau, a mechanic. Aytes, a news reporter. What motivates them is the ultimate safe zone that they have to reach so that they can finally rest from all the infected and special infected attacking them, and each other.

Antagonists/special infected

For antagonists, I’m gonna put the special infected. Special infected are mutated from the virus. Tank, strongest mutated zombie, able to punch cars towards players, and pick up concrete from the floor to throw to players. Hunter, an agile mutated zombie, launches himself from big buildings to attack the survivors. Boomer, a chubby-fat mutated zombie that pukes at the player, his puke is able to call a horde of infected towards players. Smoker, a mutated with a long tongue, able to pull survivors to himself at great distances, at close enough range, the Smoker starts punching the players while being grabbed by the tongue. Charger, a mutated zombie with one big arm, with that arm, he’s able to charge at players, when he charges at a player and successfully hits them he has to either crash into a wall, or he can just stop. After doing both those things, the charger starts slamming the players/survivors to the ground or roof. 

Key characters

For this one, I’ll put other chopper pilots. After reaching the end of a map, the survivors have to call a helicopter pilot through a radio, or get their attention. In one of the maps the players/survivors reach, they use a radio to call a boat over.

Target Market/Audience

The type of people that would play my game would be people that are trying to relive their childhood, or they like hard games like this. It would also be because of story themes because the ambience of this game is scary sometimes. They would enjoy it due to the variety of weapons the players/survivors can find, many different guns, and many things to scavenge.

Player Motivations

Exploring new levels and progressing through the story is what would keep the player playing since there’s this AI that reads the situation and gets to decide to put medkits, spawn hordes, spawn ammo, spawn melee, etc..

Unique selling point (USP)

What makes this game stand out is that it’s replayable which means someone can play this game 100 times and discover something new

Inspirations & Competition

Games that I love that are like this are Left 4 Dead 1 and 2\. I basically learned some things from this game, plot and infection.

Competition

One game it would compete with would be Project Zomboid, another fun zombie game which is more realistic on logic.

Goals

I hope that players can feel frustration, wonder, fear, and excitement from this game because it includes many things.
